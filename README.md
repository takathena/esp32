### 2. The Software I use

1. `Thony` : You can use another code editor to make it easier for you to work on the project.
2. `Driver` : Follows Instruction on This [`Website`](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-esp8266-usb-drivers-cp210x-windows/) or download directly from my repo [`repo`](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-esp8266-usb-drivers-cp210x-windows/)


## How It Works

How to use my code is simple. `Copy and Paste` my code an place to `main.py` or save this repo to your computer. 
- `main.py` is located in your ESP32

- use this command to clone this repo
```bash
    cd <uptoyou>
    git clone https://github.com/takathena/esp32.git
```
